# OI-Interface-Tools
Software tools for managing input/output files for image reconstruction and model-fitting from optical interferometric data

A standard interface to image reconstruction algorithms is being developed at https://github.com/emmt/OI-Imaging-JRA . This repository contains tools for managing FITS files, used as input to and output from the algorithms, that follow this standard.

Currently this repository contains several Python modules plus a script that creates, modifies, or lists parameters from image reconstruction input/output FITS files.
